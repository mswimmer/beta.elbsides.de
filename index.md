Such an event cannot be organized without the support of the community as the admission fee is mearly a token amount. So we cannot thank our sponsors enough in making this event possible.

We are currently sponsored by [DFN-CERT](https://www.dfn-cert.de) and [BSidesMunich](https://www.bsidesmunich.org), but we need more.
	
As a community event, we strive to keep admission as low as possible but the fixed costs are high. We are dependent on sponsors to make this event happen.
